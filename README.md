## How GitHub Fixer Works in PRs  

- **If the issue is fixable**, GitHub Fixer will display a comment with a **fix suggestion**. Users will have the option to:  
  - Visit the **fix page**  
  - Apply the fix directly via a **button**  

- **If the issue is categorized as Irrelevant but is fixable**, an **additional message** will be displayed, explaining why the issue is considered **irrelevant**.  

- **If the issue is both Irrelevant and non-fixable**, a **comment** will explain why the issue cannot be fixed.  

This repository helps validate the behavior of GitHub Fixer and ensures proper handling of vulnerabilities across different categories.
